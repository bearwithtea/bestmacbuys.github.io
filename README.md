### Decisions Decisions...
<p>Apple's line-up may have been simplified from what it was in the 90s, but it can still be confusing. Can you tell me every iPad they're currently offering?</p>
<p>As the designated "Apple Guy" in my circles, my family and friends frequently as me which Mac, iPhone, or Watch they should buy and, while I love to help them, I can't be the only one experiencing this.</p>
<p> BestMacBuys is designed to give a recommendation for which current Apple offering is best for a specific use case. </p>
